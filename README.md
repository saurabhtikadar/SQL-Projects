# SQL Projects

Welcome to my **SQL-Projects** repository! This folder contains a collection of SQL-based projects where I explore, analyze, and solve real-world problems using Structured Query Language (SQL). Each project demonstrates my skills in database management, querying, and data analysis.

## About
This repository serves as a portfolio of my SQL work, including:
- Data analysis queries for insights and reporting.
- Database design and optimization.
- Complex joins, subqueries, and window functions.
- Practical applications in business, finance, e-commerce, and more.

<!--## Projects
Below is a list of projects included in this folder. Click on each to explore the SQL scripts and their objectives.

1. **[Project Name 1]** - A brief description of what this project does (e.g., Analyzed sales data to identify top-performing products using GROUP BY and JOINs).
2. **[Project Name 2]** - Short summary (e.g., Designed a database schema for a library management system with normalized tables).
3. *(Add more projects as you create them)*

## How to Use
- Each project folder contains:
  - SQL scripts (`.sql` files) with queries or database setup.
  - A `README.md` explaining the projectâ€™s purpose, dataset, and key queries.
  - Sample datasets (if applicable, in `.csv` or `.sql` format).
- Feel free to clone this repository and run the SQL scripts in your preferred database environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

## Tools & Technologies
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (or others you use).
- **Other**: CSV datasets, Jupyter Notebooks (if you include data analysis).

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/SQL-Projects.git`
2. Navigate to a project folder and review its `README.md`.
3. Import datasets and run the `.sql` files in your SQL client.
