<h1 align="center">Ola Project - SQL Data Analyst</h1>


This is an SQL-based project aimed at solving data analysis challenges for Ola, a popular ride-hailing service. The solution is being implemented using **PostgreSQL** as the database management system.

## üõ†Ô∏èProject Overview
In this project, I will be analyzing various datasets related to Ola's operations, including ride details, customer ratings, driver performance, cancellations, and payment methods. The project will involve performing advanced SQL queries to extract insights, generate reports, and create views that can provide meaningful data for decision-making.

  
## ü§ñTechnology Use
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Language**: SQL (Structured Query Language)
  

## **üíæDataset Preparation in PostgreSQL**
To analyze the data and address the Bussiness Question of this project, 
we need to create a table in PostgreSQL that includes all the required columns.

**1. üõ¢Ô∏èUse a Staging Table with All Columns as `TEXT`:**

Create a temporary staging table where all columns are defined as `TEXT` to ensure the CSV data is imported `without errors`.
```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    date TEXT,
    time TEXT,
    booking_id TEXT,
    booking_status TEXT,
    customer_id TEXT,
    vehicle_type TEXT,
    pickup_location TEXT,
    drop_location TEXT,
    v_tat TEXT,
    c_tat TEXT,
    canceled_rides_by_customer TEXT,
    canceled_rides_by_driver TEXT,
    incomplete_rides TEXT,
    incomplete_rides_reason TEXT,
    booking_value TEXT,
    payment_method TEXT,
    ride_distance TEXT,
    driver_ratings TEXT,
    customer_rating TEXT);

```
**2. üì•Import the [Data](https://github.com/saurabhtikadar/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Ola%20Project/Bookings.csv) into the Staging Table:**

Use the `COPY` command to load the data into the staging table.
```sql
COPY bookings
FROM '/path/to/your/Sample.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```
**3. üìáExtract the Date from the `Date Column`**

If the `date_column` in your [bookings.csv](https://github.com/saurabhtikadar/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Ola%20Project/Bookings.csv) file contains both date and time (e.g., `"26-07-2024 14:00"`), and you want to change its data type to `DATE`,
you will face an issue because the `DATE` data type cannot store time information. To handle this:
```sql
UPDATE bookings
SET date = LEFT(date, 10);
```
**Note :** This query extracts the first 10 characters from the `date_column` (which correspond to the date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`) and updates the column.

**4. üîÑChange the Data Type to `DATE`**

After ensuring the column contains only the date, change its data type to `DATE` using:
```sql
ALTER TABLE bookings
ALTER COLUMN date TYPE DATE
USING TO_DATE(date, 'DD-MM-YYYY');
```
**Pro Tip :** To avoid these issues altogether, you can clean and prepare your data in `Excel` before importing it into PostgreSQL.

**5. ‚û°Ô∏èReplace `"null"` with SQL `NULL`**

To ensure a smooth data type conversion, first check if the column contains string representations of null values (e.g., `"null"`) and convert them to SQL `NULL`.
This ensures that non-numeric values won't cause `errors` during the conversion process.

**Example :** In this [Sample.csv] file presence of `null` values in the `driver_ratings` and `customer_rating` columns:
```sql
UPDATE bookings
SET driver_ratings = NULL, customer_rating = NULL
WHERE driver_ratings = 'null' OR customer_rating = 'null';

```
**6. üîÑConvert `NUMERIC` Data Type**

Now, Any columns that store digits but have their data type as `TEXT` will be converted to a `NUMERIC` data type for better accuracy and efficiency.
```sql
ALTER TABLE bookings
ALTER COLUMN driver_ratings TYPE NUMERIC USING driver_ratings::NUMERIC,
ALTER COLUMN customer_rating TYPE NUMERIC USING customer_rating::NUMERIC,
ALTER COLUMN ride_distance TYPE  NUMERIC USING ride_distance::NUMERIC,
ALTER COLUMN booking_value TYPE  NUMERIC USING booking_value::NUMERIC;
```

<h1 align="center">üìä Data Analysis with SQL Queries</h1>

Below are the steps to solve each business question. Simply run the query `SELECT * FROM view_name;` to see the results for each problem.

**1. üéØRetrieve all successful bookings**: The query retrieves all bookings that were successfully completed.

**2. üöóFind the average ride distance for each vehicle type**: The query calculates the average ride distance for each type of vehicle.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW avg_dis_for_each_vehicle AS
SELECT vehicle_type,ROUND(AVG(ride_distance),2) AS avg_distance

### üìúExplanation of the Added SQL Queries:
- **Query 1-10**: Each query directly addresses a specific question, such as retrieving successful bookings, calculating average ride distances, or listing the top customers. They are written in standard SQL and designed to work with the "bookings" table.
